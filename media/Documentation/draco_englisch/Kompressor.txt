Inside the compressor the pulses' time dilation, as induced by the stretcher, is reversed. The diversification of the wave length compponents happens again by bending with an optical grid. Due to the reversed beam paths towards the stretcher, the wave length components shift on top of each other and form an ultra short pulse, that was created in the oscillator. The pulse duration is 25 femtoseconds after the compressor. In this shrot time the laser pulse produces an capacity of around 150 terrawatts corrosponding to that of 100 times of all the earth's power plants.
