The Pockels cell consists of a crystal to which shortly a high electric current can be applied by the help of two electrodes. The voltage application changes the optical properties of the crystal so it's index of refraction changes proportionally to the field strength of the laser pulse. This is achieved by the crystal becoming birefringent once a voltage is applied and thus differently polarised light beams are refracted differently inside the crystal. This is called the electro-optical "Pockels effect", after the german physicist Friedrich Carl Alwin Pockels (* June 18 1865 in Vicenza; † August 29 1913 in Heidelberg).
The polarisation of light specifies the alignment of the electic and magnetic fields of the laser pulse towards it's direction of propagation. In case of a linear polarisation, the fields stand orthogonally towards it's direction of propagation. Only linearly polarised light can pass a polarisation filter if the field direction is selected correctly, otherwise the light is blocked.
With the Pockels cell the polarisation, meaning the field direction, can be rotated shortly. The Pockels cell allows the polarisation of the laser pulse so that it may pass or be blocked by the polarisation filter. Thus it is possible to build a fast optical switch, either blocking or letting the laser pulse pass.
