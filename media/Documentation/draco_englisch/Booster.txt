The booster selects a few pulses from the 78 Mhz pulse train of the oscillator and amplify their energy signifficantly, therefore levelling the losses in subsequent components. The heavy decrease of the repetition rate, meaning the number of pulses per time, is necessary because the whole laser system is only designed for a maximum of 10 pulses per second (10 Hz). The selected pulses are amplified be 20000.
