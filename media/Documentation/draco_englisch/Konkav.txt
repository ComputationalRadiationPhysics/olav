In the subsequent arrangement of curved mirrors the different wave lengths have to travel varying optical paths due to the diversification, and thus are arranged consecutively in time. The pulse is stretched in length. The arrangement is chosen so that the long-wave parts have to travel the shortest way and therefore are situated at the beginning of the pulse.
