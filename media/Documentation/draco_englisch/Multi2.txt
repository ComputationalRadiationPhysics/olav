Before entering the second multipass amplfier, the laser pulse has gathered an energy of 25 millijoules. With every subsequent amplification the demands towards the green pump laser rise. While the previous steps got by with relatively small pump lasers, the MP2 now needs a very strong pump laser to ensure the required energy (about 1 Joule per pulse). The last step requires even 9 of these lasers to achieve the targetted energy for the laser pulse.
