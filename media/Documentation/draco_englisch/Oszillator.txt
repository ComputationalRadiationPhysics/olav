The oscillator is the entry point of the whole laser system; here optical pulses are created that are amplified by multiple magnitudes in the following. The pulse duration is extremely short, it accounts to about 10 femtoseconds (10-15 seconds). In this short duration the light covers a distance of just about 3 micrometers (a millionth meter), thus the pulses are light slices that are thinner than a human hair. An oscillator consists of a closed resonator composition, where light pulses are constantly circulating. The oscillator used here produces 78 million pulses per second, each of which features an energy of just afew nanojoule (a billionth Joule).
