The Pac-Man is named after the popular video game character. It consists of two mirrors arranged orthogonally to each other. They are envelopped by a circular wrap causing the arrangement to look like the protagonist of the classic video game. The laser pulse hits the Pac-Man mirror in a 45° angle and is in turn steered towards the upper mirror. Therefore it is reflected in the same direction it came from, but shifted in height.
This arrangement allows the pulse to pass the mirrors of the multipass amplifier a second time with a different height. Thus the number of passes can be doubled and a stronger amplification can be achieved.
