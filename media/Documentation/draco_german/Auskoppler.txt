As the name suggests, this special mirror is used to disengage a certain part of the circulating laser pulse out of the resonator. The surface of the mirror is built to ensure that the laser pulse is not completely reflected, but a small part is transmitted, that may leave the resonator. Here the laser pulse loses a little part of it's energy, that is replenished in the next circuit through the Ti:sa crystal.
