With every amplification a part of the energy deposited inside the crystal by the pump laser is passed onto the laser pulse and the latter is thus amplified. Within this process a small fraction of the deposited energy is converted into heat. The effect is of such significance inside the MP2, that waste heat warms up the crystal if not effectively conducted by a water cooling system. Heating causes a decline of the beam profile and can even destroy the crystal.
