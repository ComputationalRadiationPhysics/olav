A multi-pass amplifier consists of an array of mirrors staggered towards each other, grouped around a central, optical gain medium.
A gain medium can amplify incoming light through so-called stimulated emissions.

Stimulated atoms are inside the gain medium, meaning atoms that have collected spare energy in form of potential energy of it's electrons.
This energy can then be released in form of light if radiated with a certain (often the same) frequency.
Thus a gain medium can emitt more light of the same frequency than it absorbs.

Thereto it needs energy itself, meaning energy must be applied from the outside into the medium to achieve the amplification of the laser pulse.
The can be achieved by a process called "pumping".
Here energy is "pumped" into the gain medium, meaning the atoms are stiumlated, thus emitting their collected energy through stimulated emission.

In case of the titan-sapphire crystal (Ti:Sa crystal), used as an optical gain medium inside the booster, an additional green laser can be used as an energy source to "pump".
It's light stimulates the atoms inside the crystal, thus causing them to emitt light if they are hit by the longer wave length of the amplifying laser pulse.

This way energy is transferred from the green pump laser into the laser pulse.

In order to use this process as often as possible, the gain medium is traversed multiple times inside the multipass amplifier at various points.

To achieve this, the laser pulse is reflected over the course of multiple mirrors each time with a spatial offset, thus traversing the crystal mutiple times.
With every pass through the crystal the laser pulse is amplified. The number of passes is determined by the maximum amplification.
