The dichroid is a mirror, that is penetrable by light of a certain scope of wave lengths while being impenetrable, meaning reflecting, by another.
A mirror like that allows light with a certain frequency (the green light of the Verdi pump laser) to enter the cavity, while keeping the long-wave infrared light of the laser pulse out of the cavity.

The light of the laser pulse hence is being reflected in and out of the cavity while the green light of the pump laser just passes through the cavity's mirrors.
Thus it is easily accomplished to overlap the pump beam with the laser pulse inside the Ti:Sa crystal.
