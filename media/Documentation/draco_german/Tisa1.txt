The titan-sapphire crystal (Ti:Sa crystal) is an optical gain medium. 

It allows to save energy from a green laser light and converts it so that it can be used to amplify the energy of the short laser pulse.

This happens due to the atoms inside the crystal being stimulated by the green laser light of the verdi laser.
The energy is saved as potential energy of it's electrons.

This potential energy can be emitted by the electrons if they are stimulated by light of another wave length. 
It is referred to as "stimulated emission". The appropriate wave length is the central wave length of our laser pulse of 800 nm.

It lies in the infrared scope of the light spectrum and is almost invisible for the human eye.

The Ti:Sa crystal allows energy to be transferred to the laser pulse.
It gets the necessary energy from the green light of the verdi pump laser.
